Shiny Apps
-----------------

These are some shiny apps I've written to use with teaching statistics.  More features to come as I have more time to work on these.

You should be able to run the following shinyApps with the following commands:

shiny::runGitHub('shinyApps', 'lebebr01', subdir = 'CI')

shiny::runGitHub('shinyApps', 'lebebr01', subdir = 'CLT')

shiny::runGitHub('shinyApps', 'lebebr01', subdir = 'SampDist')
